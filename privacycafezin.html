  <h1>Privacy and Security Policy of the Cafezin App</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 9, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Cafezin respects and protects the privacy of its users. This policy clearly and transparently describes how the app handles data, permissions, and security, in compliance with App Store requirements.</p>

  <h2>2. Information Collected</h2>
  <p>Cafezin does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information. The app works entirely locally on the user's device and does not connect to external servers.</p>
  <p>The only information used, locally on the device, includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Current device time:</strong> Used to personalize greeting messages and determine the ‚Äúdrink of the day,‚Äù which updates automatically at midnight (based on the device's clock).</li>
    <li><strong>Usage preferences (such as filters and searches):</strong> Used only within the app to improve navigation. This data is not transmitted or stored externally.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Permissions Used</h2>
  <p>Cafezin requests only one permission:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To send recipe suggestions and content related to the world of coffee. The user may accept or decline this permission upon first use, and can change it at any time in the system settings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Important:</strong><br>
  Cafezin does not request access to location, camera, contacts, microphone, or any other sensitive data.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Usage</h2>
  <p>Cafezin uses data solely to personalize the in-app experience. All information remains on the user‚Äôs device. The app:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Does not send data to external servers</li>
    <li>Does not use cookies or tracking technologies</li>
    <li>Does not analyze user behavior</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>Cafezin does not share any data with third parties under any circumstances.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Although no sensitive data is collected, Cafezin follows best development practices to ensure the security and stability of the app. All usage information is stored locally on the device, and the user has full control over it.</p>

  <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
  <p>Since Cafezin does not collect or store personal data, there is no need to request data deletion or portability. All local data is automatically deleted when the app is uninstalled.</p>

  <h2>8. Policy Changes</h2>
  <p>This policy may be updated occasionally to reflect changes in the app. Users are encouraged to review this document periodically.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
